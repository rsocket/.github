## :question: Do you have a question?

> Search Stack Overflow first; discuss if necessary

If you're unsure why something isn't working or wondering if there is a better
way of doing it, please check on **Stack Overflow** first and if necessary start
a discussion. Use relevant tags among the ones we monitor for that purpose:
 - [`rsocket`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rsocket) for generic rsocket questions
 - `rsocket-xxx` for specific rsocket implementation in particular language questions (where `xxx` stands for a short name of the language such as `js`, `java`, etc.)

If you prefer real-time discussion, we also have a few **Gitter channels**:
 - [`rsocket`](https://gitter.im/rsocket/rsocket) specification questions and disscussions  
 - [`rsocket-community`](https://gitter.im/rsocket/community) all community questions
 - [`rsocket-java`](https://gitter.im/rsocket/rsocket-java) rsocket-java related questions

Refer to each project's README for potential other sources of information. 
	
We generally discourage opening GitHub issues for questions, in favor of the two channels above.
